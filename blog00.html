									<h2>Personal Statement</h2>
								</header>

								<p>
								<header>
									<h3>Who I am and what I have been through</h3>
								</header>
									Hello! I'm Chiwon Lee a student at Yonsei University studying Information and Interaction Design.
									I have previously studied at Samsung Art & Design Institute,
									the University of Nottingham Ningbo China, and Columbia University in the City of New York.
									When I was in Samsung Art & Design Institute, I studied Fashion Design, when I was in China,
									I studied Product Design and Manufacture Engineering, and when I was at Columbia, I studied Computer Science.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have lived in Tennessee, Seoul, Seattle, Tokyo, Ningbo, and a few other places.
									I especially have a special place in my heart for Seattle and Ningbo.
									I love Seattle because that was the time when I was truly myself.
									I was passionate, I was goal-driven, I went to as most parties that I could,
									and I wasn't scared to express myself or my emotions to the people around me.
									I would study hard, shop hard for quality food and garments, eat as much as I wanted,
									and think profusely about my future. My sole goal was to escape Seattle when I was in Seattle
									by extracting everything that I can from the place, but now looking back at the experience,
									I would like to go back and give myself a pat on the back for being myself and working hard.
									I really miss Ningbo as well. It was more like a vacation spot than a school to me.
									There were palm trees on campus, hotpot options on campus, parties everyday, and a carefree vibe.
									I used to attend a university that was known for its cutthroat culture,
									so the culture at Ningbo was an extreme shock to me. I miss going about my days eating phenomenal
									fried rice at $1.5, the ripest mangoes at $2, going to parties at night with people that
									looked genuinely happy. Although there were incidents that made me not desire to live there full time,
									I still think Ningbo is an extremely nice place to stay at to clear oneâ€™s mind.

									<h3>Things that I like</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										I like cutting edge technology, good food, a good laugh, and doing things via passion.
										Here is a list of things that I like:

										<p>
										1. I like hotel buffets, especially in South Korea, with a special heart for the Four Seasons
										as I believe that their food is exemplary when it comes to quality, and because
										I love anything similar to Mac & Cheese and great quality dessert.
										</p>

										<p>
										2. I like reading articles or watching youtube on individuals that have gone through
										obstacles in their life but have overcome them with positivity. I am also an avid fan
										of people who did not take the traditional path to success as I am inspired by people
										who are able to learn in situations that are not the norm. I was especially
										inspired by a person who decided to go to a college in the United States at
										the age of 26 without being able to speak English fluently. He is currently
										now one of the lead designers at Lyft, in California, and I have confidence
										in my voice when I say that he is a role model for following his passion.
										</p>

										<p>
										3. I love desserts of good quality. I am into a bread that is drenched in
										honey and gorgonzola at a bakery that is approximately a 30-40 minute walk
										from campus. I live in the school dormitory, and I walk almost daily solely
										for the purpose of purchasing that bread that I love. The bakery that sells
										the bread is named "Rolling Pin" and according to my memory, the bread
										is named "Miel Gorgonzola." Not far away from the bakery, there is also
										a cafe called "Dore Dore," which is a cake shop that was founded by a
										Yonsei University graduate. Although I have only tried the cake there
										for one time because of my misconception that the cake might not be
										that good because it was too colorful and pretty, the cake that they
										sell there is my favorite. To get the cake in hand, I have visited
										the cafe over 3 times, but I have failed to obtain the rainbow whipped
										cream cake that I love. It's approximately $8 for one piece but I am
										willing to take on another attempt on attaining the cake since I have
										learned that I am supposed to strive in life for happiness.
										</p>

											<h3>
												What I would like to learn from the course
											</h3>
										</header>
										I would love to learn more about context mapping as
										I believe that it is integral when it comes to the trajectory of human-computer interaction.
									</p>

										<h3>My Dreams</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										I wish to become an interaction designer in the future.
										I wish to be able to call one of the most innovative companies
										on this planet home and go apple picking on the weekends while
										conceptualizing my next project on the way there with passion.
										It is my dream to go to work with excitement and content rather than dread,
										and I am here to become closer to that dream.
