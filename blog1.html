									<h2>Documenting a Game Experience</h2>

									<h3>What have I done?</h3>
								</header>
									I have chosen Medium as a medium to experience the world of gaming as I believe that
									online writing platforms are like the microcosm of how the society works, which I believe
									is the most intriguing game of all.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have chosen to create an alter ego on Medium and write one post per day for the
									course of three days to experience the activity of expressing my alternative self online.
									I believe that this is an alternative self because the real me never posts anything online
									as it can be proven through my Facebook, Instagram, and other social media accounts.
									Although I have been on Quora for more than four years and Medium for more than two,
									I have not posted a single post or comment. I have not reacted in any way to the post
									if it would be visible to another user as well.
									Therefore, the activity of posting itself was an extremely big feat for me,
									and a characteristic of a more braver alternative self that I took upon the past
									three days (09/23/2019-09/25/2019).

									<h3>What I have learned?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										I learned that even though I have a decade of contemplating on how my online alter ego
										would be like, I am still clueless, and that I am very occupied with my offline self
										to the point that it is very exhausting to post online.
										I should really find a good balance to manage my offline self and online self.
										I kind of understand why I wasn't able to create an online self as it requires
										a great amount of energy.
										I spend about three to four hours on commute and about four to five hours of working
										daily not including the time that I spend to attend or complete my coursework
										so I am very tired.


										<p>
										However, I also feel new. I feel that this is a step that the old me would only
										wish but never take action on so it's like a bucket list ticked off.
										</p>

										<p>
										Another thing that I feel is the need for minimalism. You really need to
										get rid of things in your life that would deter you from taking on
										activities like this.
										</p>

										<h3>Show me what you did!</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Showing is usually more straightforward than talking so let me present to
										you the writings that I have done for this experience:
