									<h3>What have I done?</h3>
								</header>
									I have also chosen to participate in three competitions as a means
									to experience gaming as participating in competitions has been
									a sport that I enjoy ever since I was in kindergarten.
								</p>
								<p>
									I find competitions quite exciting as it gives you a healthy
									but challenging amount of anxiety just enough to keep you
									motivated and not to the verge of you having an anxiety attack,
									which I believe that is a quality of a good game.

										I worked for six hours on top of a three hour commute so:
