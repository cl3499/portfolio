									<h2>Research Paper for Reference</h2>
								</header>

								<h3>"Necessary, Unpleasant, and Disempowering: Reputation Management in the Internet Age"</h3>
								published by Allison Woodruff from Google and published in CHI 2014.<br>
								<p><a href="https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub43014/">View paper</a></p>

								<p>
									I chose this paper as my User Experience Research Methods Professor
									recommended that this paper is well written and well organized, and thus
									apt for reference for those wish to draft a research paper.

									As I chose a vanity platform, Medium, I believe that this paper
									of reputation management in the online arena is useful as vanity
									is related to reputation management.
								</p>

								<p>
									I have also looked at other papers to reference regarding the
									creation of a toolkit for design, and I have concluded that
									conducting in-depth interviews would be an effective method
									to research on regarding vanity platforms although I am
									still also interested in methods on designing a creative toolkit
									that involves but is not limited to diary studies and original
									ideas such as interactive toys that would allow me to further
									understand the context of the platform that I chose.
